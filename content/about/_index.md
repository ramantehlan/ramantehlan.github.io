I am a computer engineer with a passion for building scalable and distributed systems. I am currently working at StockGro, where we are building the future of investing. Previously, I worked at IBM Research, Google Summer of Code, Udacity, and Knowlarity. 

I enjoy working on projects that have a positive impact on the world. I believe in open source and have contributed to many projects. I also like being a part of or building tech communities and have previously been a part of communities like ILUGD, PyDelhi, and organized events like PyData Delhi Meetup and Conference.
